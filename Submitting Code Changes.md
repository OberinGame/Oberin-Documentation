# Submitting Code Changes

Git is used to hold the source code. We use common git uses in maintaining the code base.

Common git commands:
- Pulling the latest changes `git pull`
- Switching to a branch `git checkout OtherBranchName`
- Creating a new branch `git checkout -b NewBranchName`
- Adding the changes you made to a git commit `git add *`
- Creating a new commit with the changes you made `git commit -m 'These are my changes, they do this.'`
- Pushing the changes to your branch `git push`

# Submitting Code Changes with Pull Requests
A pull request is used to submit code to the master repository.

1. Create a fork or branch of the master repository.
2. Make modifications and push them to your branch.
2. Create a new pull request from your branch to the main repository from the Github website.
3. Members of the repository will review, comment on your code, and approve it if it is worth adding.
4. Your code is now a part of the main repository.
